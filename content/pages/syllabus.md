## Course Meeting Time

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

6.5620\[J\] Foundations of Cryptography

## Summary

This course is about the evolution of proofs in computer science.  We will learn about the power of interactive proofs, multi-prover interactive proofs, and probabilistically checkable proofs.  We will then show how to use cryptography to convert these powerful proof systems into computationally sound non-interactive arguments (SNARGs).

## Readings

Within each lecture, students will find the lecture videos and the readings assigned.

## Deliverables

1\. Each student will be asked to scribe one lecture. The notes should be taken on Overleaf.

2\. We will also have one homework: {{% resource_link "efdbf466-ff7f-47a4-8e4b-604ba9217203" "Advanced Topics in Cryptography Problem Set (PDF)" %}}.
