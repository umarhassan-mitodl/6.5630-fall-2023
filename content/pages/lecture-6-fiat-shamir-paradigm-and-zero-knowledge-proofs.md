## Topics

- Eliminating interaction via the Fiat-Shamir paradigm.
- The random oracle model (ROM).
- Proof of the soundness of the Kilian-Micali protocol in the ROM (more generally, proof of soundness of any constant round protocol with negligible soundness).
- Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP).
- ZKP for NP: Specifically for the Hamiltonian cycle NP-complete language.Â 
- ROM fails for this ZKP since it does not have negligible soundness, and the sequential repetition is not constant rounds.
